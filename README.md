# Ricochet

## Description

Based on the MOD Audio pitch shifting plugins: https://github.com/mod-audio/mod-pitchshifter

Inspired by the classic DigiTech Whammy Ricochet(*), this pitch-shifter can shift an input pitch from -24 semitones down to +24 semitones up. Functionality mimics the behaviour of the original hardware pedal, including:
* Momentary and latching modes,
* Adjustable shift and return times,
* A clean blend option,
* Selectable pitch shift direction, and
* Interval selection.


## Controls Usage
* "Interval" selects the target pitch step (2nd, 4th, 5th, Octave, etc.) and "Direction" chooses whether that sweep goes up or down.
* "Shift Time" and "Return Time" define how fast the pitch glides to and from the target when the trigger engages or releases.
* Use "Mode" to pick momentary or latching behaviour. 
* "Clean" adds the dry signal (automatically enabled for the Octave+Dry interval) and "Gain" controls the wet level only.
* "Fidelity" sets, well, the fidelity of the plugin. As you lower the fidelity, the sound will become less pristine, but the plugin will also use less processing. The opposite holds true for increasing the fidelity, this will grant you a clearer pitch-shifted signal at the cost of significantly more processing being used. 
  * The Lo-Fi setting is reminiscent of bit-crushed sounds, if you are looking for those synthesizer-like basslines, or dirty octave-up sounds, this is your setting!
  * The Hi-Fi setting is great if you are looking to emulate (for example) something like a 12-string guitar, be sure to mind that CPU-meter in the bottom-right of the screen though! 
  * The settings in between are created to let you make the perfect trade-off between quality and performance.
